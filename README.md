# **Maritime Merchants**

Maritime Merchants is a web-based trading and strategy game where you step into the role of a 16th-century merchant. Your mission is to amass wealth by buying goods in one port and selling them for a profit in another. Navigate the high seas, manage your resources, and upgrade your vessel to become the most successful trader of the era.

This was part of an AP World project that was focused on maritime technologies. To play, just download the repository and open index.html in your browser.
